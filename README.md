# Engineer Investor's Finance Education

Welcome to the Engineer Investor's Finance Education repository! This platform is dedicated to sharing insightful financial and stock market analysis knowledge, aiming to bridge the gap between engineering acumen and investment savvy. Whether you're an experienced investor, a curious engineer looking to diversify your skillset, or a finance student eager to apply theoretical knowledge practically, this repository is designed to cater to your needs.

## About

Engineer Investor's Finance Education is a growing collection of tutorials, code snippets, and insightful discussions focused on financial analysis and stock market evaluation. By leveraging programming, particularly Python, to dissect and understand the dynamics of the financial world, this repository aims to provide practical, hands-on learning experiences.

## Getting Started

To dive into the world of finance through the lens of engineering and data analysis, here's how you can get started:

1. **Explore Existing Tutorials**: Begin with our tutorials, such as computing the Sharpe ratio of a stock or fund from scratch. These tutorials are designed to be accessible yet informative, providing a solid foundation in financial analysis techniques.

   - [Computing Sharpe Ratio of a Stock Using T-Bill Return Data with Python](https://github.com/engineerinvestor/Finance-Education/blob/main/Computing_Sharpe_Ratio_of_a_Stock_Using_T_Bill_Return_Data_with_Python.ipynb) is a great starting point. It walks you through the process of calculating the Sharpe ratio, a key metric for assessing investment performance relative to its risk.

2. **Run Tutorials in Google Colab**: For a seamless experience, you can run most tutorials directly in Google Colab (http://colab.research.google.com). This doesn't require any setup on your part and allows you to experiment with the code in a cloud-based Python notebook environment.

3. **Download and Customize**: Feel free to download, modify, and run the code on your local machine. Each tutorial is designed to be open-source, encouraging modifications, improvements, and customizations to suit your personal or educational needs.
